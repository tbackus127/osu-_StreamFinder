# osu-_StreamFinder
A program that finds all streams (quick succession of hit circles) in your beatmap library and outputs the corresponding BPM.

osu! is a rhythm game that I play often. I'm horrible at streams, so why not hasten the learning process by filtering out songs that don't have streams?
